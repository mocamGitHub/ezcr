My final concern is attaching the bike to the ramp, as there is are not alot of frame points still available due to body moldings.\r\n\r\nThanks again and always feel free to call me with thoughts.

If not, do you recomend/offer any kit/option?\r\n\r\nWe need to purchase any other EZ Cycle Accessorie to better operates our ramp or this model is enough by itself?\r\n\r\nIf I go to your location in Georgia, do you offer a instalation service? If yes, how much is that? Anyways, let me know the shipping costs to Fort Lauderdale, FL - zip: 33315.\r\n\r\nIf necessary, I can provide you my Resale Tax Certificate to avoid the sale tax charge, as I\'m going to use it for my rental business, I mean, resale the service when towing service is needed, charging the sale tax to the final customer;\r\n\r\nCould you check the possibility to apply any discount in this order? I have the potential to resell other units to other Eaglerider locations, as well as to other Latin American countries with which I have a strong commercial/export relationship for the motorsports industry. We are one family-owned operated EagleRider motorcycle store/franchise, so anything helps...\r\n\r\nOur intention is leave it installed in the truck and remove just if it may necessary for some situation;\r\n\r\nThank you very much and please advise.', '', '', '', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '2025-02-11 01:59:17'),
