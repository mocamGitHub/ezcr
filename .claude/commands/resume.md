Read and analyze the SESSION_HANDOFF.md file in the project root to understand:
1. What work was completed in the last session
2. Current state of the project
3. Pending tasks and next steps
4. Technical architecture and patterns used

Then provide a brief summary of:
- What was accomplished
- Current git status (check with git log --oneline -5)
- Dev server status (check if running)
- Recommended next actions

After the summary, ask what the user would like to work on next.
