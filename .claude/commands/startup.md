Help me get back to work after a break or reboot. Please:

1. Check if SESSION_HANDOFF.md exists and read it thoroughly
2. Check git status: `git status` and `git log --oneline -5`
3. Check if dev server is running (look for running processes on ports 3000-3010)
4. If dev server is NOT running, start it with `npm run dev` in background

Then provide a comprehensive status report including:
- Summary of last session's work (from SESSION_HANDOFF.md)
- Current git branch and commit status
- Dev server status and URL
- Any uncommitted changes
- Recommended next actions based on the handoff document

Finally, ask: "What would you like to work on?" with 2-3 specific suggestions based on the pending work in the handoff.
